# DataQualityProject
The goal of the project is to perform an accuracy assessment over two dataset. First, we inject missing data on the datasets, then we apply some imputation techiniques. Finally, we do an accuracy assessement and we apply some Machine Learning algorithms in order to compare the imputation techiniques.
